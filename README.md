An agent-based model of social equilibrium with quantal response
================================================================

This project tries to compare agent-based and maximum entropy modelling in the
context of a simple social equilibrium problem. In particular, we develop an
agent-based model of a general problem of firms deciding whether to enter a
market with features inspired by quantal response statistical equilibrium
techniques.
